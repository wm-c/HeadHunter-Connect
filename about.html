        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8">We are a group of Ivey students driven by a passion to solve a real-world
            problem faced by many small businesses. Our journey began after hearing about the challenges one of our team
            member's father encountered while trying to expand his recruitment efforts to other regions. That
            conversation sparked the creation of a platform that bridges the gap between headhunters and other
            geographies, helping small firms connect with the talent they need at affordable rates.</p>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8">Our platform is designed to make it easier for small businesses to extend
            their search area and build mutually beneficial relationships with other companies. By connecting
            headhunters with firms in different regions, we help small businesses access qualified candidates in new
            areas for smaller fees, ultimately increasing their reach and boosting their revenues.</p>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8">At the core of our platform is simplicity and accessibility. We focus on
            providing an easy-to-use solution that meets the needs of smaller companies who often don't have the
            resources to explore new markets on their own. Our goal is to help level the playing field, enabling smaller
            firms to expand and grow through the power of collaboration.</p>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">Join us in creating a more connected and supportive recruitment network.</p>
